    "name": "Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells",
    "type": "strength",
    "muscle": "hamstrings",
    "equipment": "dumbbell",
    "difficulty": "beginner",
    "instructions": "Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels. Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise. When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips."

    "type": "strength",
    "muscle": "quadriceps",
    "equipment": "machine",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Load the sled to an appropriate weight. Seat yourself on the machine, planting one foot on the platform in line with your hip. Your free foot can be placed on the ground. Maintain good spinal position with your head and chest up. Supporting the weight, fully extend the knee and unlock the sled. This will be your starting position. Lower the weight by flexing the hip and knee, continuing as far as flexibility allows. Do not allow your lumbar to take the load by moving your pelvis. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly and then return to the starting position by extending the hip and knee. Complete all repetitions for one leg before switching to the other."

    "instructions": "Position a bar into a landmine or securely anchor it in a corner. Load the bar to an appropriate weight. Raise the bar from the floor, taking it to shoulder height with both hands with your arms extended in front of you. Adopt a wide stance. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by rotating the trunk and hips as you swing the weight all the way down to one side. Keep your arms extended throughout the exercise. Reverse the motion to swing the weight all the way to the opposite side. Continue alternating the movement until the set is complete."

    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Attach a weight to a dip belt and secure it around your waist. Grab the pull-up bar with the palms of your hands facing forward. For a medium grip, your hands should be spaced at shoulder width. Both arms should be extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip. You'll want to bring your torso back about 30 degrees while creating a curvature in your lower back and sticking your chest out. This will be your starting position. Now, exhale and pull your torso up until your head is above your hands. Concentrate on squeezing your shoulder blades back and down as you reach the top contracted position. After a brief moment at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position with your arms extended and your lats fully stretched."

Assume a wide stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arms should be extended. This will be your starting position. Pull the weight to your upper abdomen by retracting the shoulder blades and flexing the elbows. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement.

    "type": "strength",
    "muscle": "forearms",
    "equipment": "barbell",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench. Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench. Use your arms to grab the barbell with a pronated grip (palms down) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge. Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed. You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell."

    "name": "Atlas Stones",
    "type": "strongman",
    "muscle": "lower_back",
    "equipment": "other",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Begin with the atlas stone between your feet. Bend at the hips to wrap your arms vertically around the Atlas Stone, attempting to get your fingers underneath the stone. Many stones will have a small flat portion on the bottom, which will make the stone easier to hold. Pulling the stone into your torso, drive through the back half of your feet to pull the stone from the ground. As the stone passes the knees, lap it by sitting backward, pulling the stone on top of your thighs. Sit low, getting the stone high onto your chest as you change your grip to reach over the stone. Stand, driving through with your hips. Close distance to the loading platform, and lean back, extending the hips to get the stone as high as possible."

    "name": "Barbell glute bridge",
    "type": "powerlifting",
    "muscle": "glutes",
    "equipment": "barbell",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Begin seated on the ground with a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lay down flat on the floor. Begin the movement by driving through with your heels, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your upper back and the heels of your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position."

    "name": "Clean and press",
    "type": "strength",
    "muscle": "shoulders",
    "equipment": "barbell",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Assume a shoulder-width stance, with knees inside the arms. Now while keeping the back flat, bend at the knees and hips so that you can grab the bar with the arms fully extended and a pronated grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Point the elbows out to sides. The bar should be close to the shins. Position the shoulders over or slightly ahead of the bar. Establish a flat back posture. This will be your starting position. Begin to pull the bar by extending the knees. Move your hips forward and raise the shoulders at the same rate while keeping the angle of the back constant; continue to lift the bar straight up while keeping it close to your body. As the bar passes the knee, extend at the ankles, knees, and hips forcefully, similar to a jumping motion. As you do so, continue to guide the bar with your hands, shrugging your shoulders and using the momentum from your movement to pull the bar as high as possible. The bar should travel close to your body, and you should keep your elbows out. At maximum elevation, your feet should clear the floor and you should start to pull yourself under the bar. The mechanics of this could change slightly, depending on the weight used. You should descend into a squatting position as you pull yourself under the bar. As the bar hits terminal height, rotate your elbows around and under the bar. Rack the bar across the front of the shoulders while keeping the torso erect and flexing the hips and knees to absorb the weight of the bar. Stand to full height, holding the bar in the clean position. Without moving your feet, press the bar overhead as you exhale. Lower the bar under control ."
